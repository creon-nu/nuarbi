# Nuarbi
A trading bot that generates profit by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities in NBT markets

Using this software has several risks:

Exchange Default: This means that the exchange itself might cease the operation and won't return the customers funds. A situation like this has happened many times in the past (most prominently on BTER a while ago).

Connection Issues: If you are running an automated trading bot then it requires a stable internet connection to perform actions. If your internet is suddenly broken, or your computer restarts without closing the client software correctly, then there might be open orders left on the exchange which won't get closed until the connection is reestablished.

Failure of the Nu project: Since payouts are performed in NBT and your funds may be transformed to NBT, a failure of the Nu project would lead to a loss of value of your funds.

Trading Bot:
